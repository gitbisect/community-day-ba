# AWS Community Day - Bay Area

## Branch/tag convention

Do all changes on master branch. Publish the master branch. When major changes happen - mostly like when the event has ended tag it. Also tag it when updates are all done for the annoucements. So most probably you will have two tags a year. Let's see.
